        <div class="section">
            <h2>Before trading, it’s very important to read this information!</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>1. General principle of the strategy:</h3>
            <p>1. <b>The strategy analyzes price data and indicators</b> (RSI, Stoch, MACD, ATR, etc.) on 15-minute and 1-hour timeframes.</p>
            <p>2. <b>A machine learning model</b> predicts the probability of a price increase (prob_up). If the probability is high enough, the strategy suggests a <b>BUY</b> signal; if it’s low, a <b>SELL</b> signal.</p>
            <p>3. For each signal, <b>Stop-Loss (SL)</b> and <b>Take-Profit (TP)</b> are calculated based on volatility (ATR). This is done to limit losses and secure profits when the target price is reached.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>2. How to enter a trade based on the signal</h3>
            <p>1. <b>Receiving the signal</b></p>
            <p>When the bot sends a notification for a possible trade (with specified Entry, SL, and TP), you will see:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Entry (Entry price)</b> – the intended price to enter the trade.</li>
                <li><b>Stop-Loss (Stop Loss)</b> – the level at which to close the trade if the price moves unfavorably.</li>
                <li><b>Take-Profit (Take Profit)</b> – the level at which to lock in profit once the price target is reached.</li>
                <li><b>Type of trade</b> (BUY or SELL) – going long (buy) or going short (sell).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>2. <b>Opening the trade</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the signal is <b>BUY</b>, place a buy order around the Entry price.</li>
                <li>If the signal is <b>SELL</b>, place a sell (short) order around the Entry price.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Note: On a real market, there might be slippage, so the actual entry price may slightly differ from the “ideal” figures.</i></p>
            <p>3. <b>Stop-Loss and Take-Profit</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Right after opening a position, <b>set the Stop-Loss (SL) and Take-Profit (TP)</b> as indicated by the bot.</li>
                <li>This prevents excessive losses if the market goes against you, and ensures profit is taken if the price reaches the target.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>3. Risk management and position sizing</h3>
            <p>1. <b>Recommended risk per trade</b> – no more than <b>1–2%</b> of your total deposit.</p>
            <p>Example: If you have 1000 USDT in your account, risk no more than 10–20 USDT (1–2% of 1000 USDT) on each trade.</p>
            <p>This approach allows you to withstand a series of losing trades without a catastrophic drop in your account balance.</p>
            <p>2. <b>Why 1–2% specifically?</b></p>
            <p>The market can be unpredictable, and losing trades are a normal part of any trading system.</p>
            <p>Trading with a small risk per trade helps maintain calm and discipline, allowing the strategy to work over the long term.</p>
            <p>3. <b>Calculating trade volume</b></p>
            <p>If a signal indicates a risk/reward ratio of about 1:1.5 or 1:2, that’s enough for a series of winning trades to cover a series of losing ones.</p>
            <p>The key is to <b>strictly adhere to your risk limits</b>, to avoid “riding out” losses, and not to open oversized positions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>4. Why the strategy can work even with < 50% winning trades</h3>
            <p>In the reports, you might notice that the <b>Win Rate</b> (the percentage of winning trades) can be around 45–50%.</p>
            <p><b>January 2025 reports</b>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Total trades: 7362</li>
                <li>Win Rate: 45.69%</li>
                <li>Final return: 495.64%</li>
                <li>Maximum drawdown: 67.30%</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite that, the final return can still be high thanks to <b>proper risk management</b> and a <b>positive “average profit / average loss” ratio</b>.</p>
            <p>In other words, <b>when a trade is profitable, the profit is usually larger than the loss in a losing trade</b>. This compensates for having only about half (or even slightly fewer) winning trades.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>5. Additional tips</h3>
            <p>1. <b>Never move the set Stop-Loss</b>. Moving the SL “further away,” hoping the market will turn around, is the quickest way to incur large losses.</p>
            <p>2. <b>Pay attention to liquidity and volatility</b>. In a calm market, signals may take longer to play out; in a volatile market, they may execute quickly.</p>
            <p>3. <b>Regularly withdraw some profit</b> (if trading on a live account). This helps lock in gains and offers psychological support.</p>
            <p>4. <b>Always remember that the market does not guarantee profit</b>. Any strategy can go through a losing streak, and you must be prepared both financially and mentally.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>6. Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The strategy is based on a mathematical model and statistics. It <b>does not provide a 100% guarantee</b>, but it can perform over the long run through strict adherence to entry, risk, and exit rules.</p>
            <p>The key to success is <b>discipline</b>. Even the best strategy can turn unprofitable if you don’t follow the prescribed risk and respect your Stop-Loss.</p>
            <p>Beginners are advised to practice on a demo account or trade with minimal volumes until they are comfortable following the system.</p>
            <p><b>Happy trading!</b> And remember, no strategy is immune to all market risks, so always trade responsibly and within your own risk tolerance.</p>
